/// of the seam and bare in between. The hysteresis (§3) and the whole-frame
/// floor (§7) also span seams, which is why Android's own per-segment file
/// stored bare tracks and rebuilt intervals globally. Analyze is also
/// the cheaper of the two passes — 10 fps sampling against the render's every
/// frame — so what a resume loses here is worth less than the correctness it
/// would cost. Stage-level resume (`Checkpoint.writeEdl`, one finished EDL) is
