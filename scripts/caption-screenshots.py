"""Compose App Store caption plates over the raw in-app captures.

Reads `docs/apple-port/screenshots/6.9/<n>-<screen>-<lang>.png` (1320x2868, the
only iPhone size App Store Connect accepts) and writes `.../plated/` at the same
size — the plate is drawn INTO the frame rather than added above it, because a
letterboxed composite is a different pixel size and gets rejected at upload.

Arabic is laid out right-to-left and shaped: PIL renders Unicode Arabic
unshaped and in logical order, so the glyphs come out disconnected and
backwards without the two passes below. If the shaping libraries are missing
the script says so and skips AR rather than emitting broken text into a store
listing.

    Two bugs live here, both of which shipped tofu into a store asset before
    being caught by looking at the PNG:

    1. The first version fell back to `ImageFont.load_default()` when the
       Arabic face would not load — and it would not, because GeezaPro is not
       at the path it assumed. The default is a tiny bitmap font with no Arabic
       coverage, so every AR plate was a row of boxes and the script still
       exited 0 saying "12 plated".
    2. The second version probed with a fixed sample word. Al Nile draws
       "مرحبا" perfectly and still has no **U+FE8D** — the isolated
       presentation form of alef — so "الأصلي" came out with one box in it.
       Many Arabic faces shape from base codepoints and omit Presentation
       Forms-B entirely, which is exactly the block `arabic_reshaper` emits.

    So the probe is the real caption, and a face that cannot draw all of it is
    skipped rather than used.
